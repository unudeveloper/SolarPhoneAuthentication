(highest priority first)

# change url_after_creates to be a class method or use after_filter
# activation code (like restful-auth) instead of salt?
# remove dependency on root_url?
# users#show doesn't exist, but confirmations create redirects there
# should_have_form should be pulled into shoulda
# generator should print out instructions to include modules existing files
# check to make sure attr_accessible doesn't override and w/ attr_protected
# move shoulda macros in test_helper to shoulda_macros folder
# add shoulda and factory girl dependencies to gemspec
# refactor Mailer default_url_options[:host] to something cleaner

ideas to steal from merb-auth:

# store current_user on the session, not controller
# respond with 401 Unauthorized when request requires authentication 
# respond with 405 Method Not Allowed when action requested isnâ€™t allowed
# email confirmation is a strategy
# forgot password is a strategy
# salted password is a strategy
# 401 and 405 need to be in Exceptions controller or use safety_valve
