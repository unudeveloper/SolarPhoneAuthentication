# check to make sure attr_accessible doesn't override and w/ attr_protected

ideas to steal from merb-auth:

# store current_user on the session, not controller
# respond with 401 Unauthorized when request requires authentication 
# respond with 405 Method Not Allowed when action requested isnâ€™t allowed
# 401 and 405 in Exceptions controller or use safety_valve
# email confirmation is a strategy
# forgot password is a strategy
# salted password is a strategy
