(this is in order of highest priority first)

h2. Password reset

# Mailer should be re-named PasswordsMailer
# passwords_controller needs to be documented in README

h2. Test coverage

# sessions controller test is missing some tests

h2. Email confirmation

We do this in every app. It should be in Clearance.

# UsersMailer will contain confirmation email 

h2. Minimize potential problems/conflicts in target Rails apps for Clearance

# check to make sure attr_accessible doesn't override and w/ attr_protected
# helpers and tests shouldn't depend on login/logout routes

h2. Cleaner code

# move shoulda macros in test_helper to shoulda_macros folder
# refactor Mailer default_url_options[:host] to something cleaner
