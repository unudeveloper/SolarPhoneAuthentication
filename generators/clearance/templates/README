Ok, enough fancy automatic stuff. Time for some old school monkey copy-pasting.

1. If you already had a User model, include the Clearance::User module now:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Clearance::User
    end

2. Define a HOST constant in your environments files.
In config/environments/test.rb and config/environments/development.rb it can be:

    HOST = "localhost"

In production.rb it must be the actual host your application is deployed to.
The constant is used by mailers to generate URLs in emails.

3. In config/environment.rb:

    DO_NOT_REPLY = "donotreply@example.com"

4. Define root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb:

    map.root :controller => 'home'
