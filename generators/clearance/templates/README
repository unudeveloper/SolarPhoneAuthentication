Ok, enough fancy automatic stuff. Time for some old school monkey copy-pasting.

1. For any other file(s) that you already had and didn't want to override, add 
the corresponding Clearance module. They are namespaced exactly like the 
directory structure of a Rails app, e.g:

if app/models/user.rb already exists, add:

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Clearance::App::Models::User
...

2. There's a couple of things you need to add to your environments files.
In config/environments/test.rb and config/environments/development.rb:

    HOST = "localhost"

In config/environment.rb:

    DO_NOT_REPLY = "donotreply@example.com"
    PROJECT_NAME = "my_app_name"  
    
3. Clearance depends on root_url, so please make sure that it is defined in 
your config/routes.rb:

    map.root :controller => 'my_home_controller'
    
4. To run tests you need to add the Clearance module to your 
test/test_helper.rb:

    class Test::Unit::TestCase
      self.use_transactional_fixtures = true
      self.use_instantiated_fixtures  = false
      include Clearance::Test::TestHelper
    end
